# INF368-Final-Project

## 1 Task
Your final project should be related to the topics of the course.
Guidelines:
1. Select one or more recently published papers in a journal (e.g., JAIR, AIJ, JMLR, ML, ACM) or in a large conference (e.g., IJCAI, AAAI, NeurIPS,
ICML) in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. You can choose the same article you presented in a reading session (or choose a new one).

2. Contact the lecturer and propose a project in which you will make an attempt to extend the results by changing the experimental setup or
reproduce them in a controlled scenario.

3. You may team up with your colleagues if the topics of the papers are close enough but each student should pick at least one paper to work on.

4. Create a plan for the project.

5. After you finish your report and code, you should prepare a 10 minutes presentation.
